# The Archive Userland Themes

This repository contains themes for the macOS note editor [*The Archive*](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/).

Theme files are located in `~/Library/Application Support/TheArchive/Themes/`. You can get there by hitting the "Open Theme Directory" button from the app's settings. Feel free to play around with the theme files there.

Q: _What if I break a built-in theme?_  
A: Don't worry, *The Archive* will re-create the themes for you on launch after you deleted them from the "Themes" directory.


## How to Submit Themes

If you're tech-savvy, create a pull request here on GitHub. The community will review your theme, may suggest changes, and then we'll merge it into this main collection.

If you don't know what this GitHub stuff is all about, [join our forums](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/) and create a new thread for your theme there for discussion. We'll take care of integrating your changes into this repository for you once the community approves.

## How to Write Themes

Themes are JSON files, ending in `.theme.json`. The expected attributes and object configurations are described in [the syntax definition.](Syntax.md)

## License

All themes are free to use and published here under the "Unlicense". Attribution to the respective theme authors would be nice, you know, but we don't want to even try to force you for theme colors. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
